# Minecraft-Themed-Slots
A minecraft themed slot machine I built for a final project back in highschool. Written in Turing.
If you'd like to check it out, you can play around with it using the Turing IDE (which you can find [here](http://compsci.ca/holtsoft/)), or if you just want to try it out you can download the .exe file!
